## Hey there 👋
I'm Perla, a Computer Science major at UC Berkeley.

My interest in technology stems from my passion for using technology to address real societal and environmental challenges. As I've learned more about the environmental cost of large-scale computing and the responsibility that technology carries, I have become committed to not only advancing technology capabilities but by doing so thoughtfully towards a safer and more sustainable world.

Currently, I am helping small businesses launch their first website!
The tools and skills I use: Squarespace, Wordpress, HTML, CSS
